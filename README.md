### why? 

the current landscape:
* overcomplicated. 
* lack of privacy. 
* focused on teams and enterprise users, not individuals. 

### how does poro address these? 

* private. user data never leaves the browser. 
* designed for humans, and does not feel robotic. 
* beautifully simple, just that. 
* still gets the job done (built-in pomodoro timer, etc)
