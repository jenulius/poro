#  :warning: still under early stages of development. major functionality still needs to be implemented

## why? 

the current landscape:
* overcomplicated. 
* lack of privacy. 
* focused on teams and enterprise users, not individuals. 
* ugly (subjective, of course)

## how does poro address these? 

* private. user data never leaves the browser. 
* designed for humans, and does not feel robotic. 
* still gets the job done (built-in pomodoro timer, etc)
* beautifully simple, just that. 


## technical overview

* react based on vite
* zustand for state management
* zustand persist for localstorage
* native boradcast web api for cross window sync

> :v:	contributions and ideas (design or technical) always welcome ðŸ™ƒ.
